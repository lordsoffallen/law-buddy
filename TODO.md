- Currently, user query is directly used to find the similar laws. However, this method often yields suboptimal 
results when the userâ€™s question is vague. Use an LLM to extract keywords from user input and search that over the law data. 
- Apply summarization over the extracted contexts to reduce context size for the Q&A model. This can potentially enable
bringing more reference from the law data. To generate this summarize, map-reduce logic can be applied. A span of text
will be selected and information reduction will be achieved via summarization. 
- Legal data requires complex reason so bigger models should do better.
